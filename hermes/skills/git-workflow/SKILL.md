# Git Workflow

Pitfalls and procedures for everyday git operations that fall outside standard
`gh` CLI workflows (for gh-specific flows see the `github` skill).

## Standing Rules

- Always check `git status` and `git remote -v` before staging or pushing.
- Configure per-repo identity before first commit if global config is absent.
- Never assume a branch name — read it from `git branch --show-current`.
- On fork/dual-remote repos, verify all three sync points before work: local branch, its tracking branch, and the canonical upstream branch — a clean `git status` alone hides upstream drift.

## Pitfalls

### Tri-branch sync check on fork/dual-remote repos

`git status` only compares the local branch against its tracking branch; it says nothing about the canonical upstream. Check all three, or work starts from a stale base.

```bash
git branch -vv                                        # which remote each local branch tracks
git config --get-regexp 'branch\.<name>\.'           # confirm tracking ref (merge = refs/heads/<branch>)
git rev-list --left-right --count local...origin/branch      # local vs fork
 git rev-list --left-right --count origin/branch...upstream/branch  # fork vs canonical
```

Read the two numbers as ahead/behind in the listed order. A non-zero behind count against upstream means fetch-then-merge before branching new work.

### Conflicting branch directives — stop and ask

When standing instructions say stay on and push the current branch but a plan doc says one branch per plan, surface the conflict and ask before creating branches or worktrees — unapproved isolation strands commits off the branch the user expects pushed.

### Nested `.git` directories when copying content

When `cp -r` (or similar) a directory that contains its own `.git` into another repo,
`git add` detects the nested `.git` and stages only a submodule reference (mode 160000),
not the actual files. Clones of the outer repo will not contain the copied content.

**Fix — remove nested `.git` before staging:**

```bash
cp -r /source/dir target/inside/repo
rm -rf target/inside/repo/.git
git add target/inside/repo/
```

If already staged as submodule:

```bash
git rm -r --cached target/inside/repo/
rm -rf target/inside/repo/.git
git add target/inside/repo/
git commit -m "Add dir contents (fix nested repo)"
```

### Unintended file changes in feature commits

When committing feature work, run `git diff --stat` before staging to catch
unintended modifications to config/meta files (e.g. `AGENTS.md`, `.hermes.md`)
that were modified by tooling or agents during the session but are not part of
the feature.

**Prevention:** `git add -p` or selective `git add <paths>` instead of
`git add -A`. Review `git diff --staged --stat` before committing.

**Fix — restore from upstream before amend:**

```bash
git show upstream/beta:AGENTS.md > AGENTS.md
git add AGENTS.md
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

### Missing git identity on fresh clones

New clones may lack both global and per-repo `user.name`/`user.email`.
Commits fail with `empty ident name`.

**Fix — set per-repo config before first commit:**

```bash
git config user.email "user@users.noreply.github.com"
git config user.name "username"
```

Detect from `gh auth status` or set manually.

## Verification

- `git status` shows no unexpected submodule entries.
- `git diff --cached --stat` shows actual file additions, not just mode changes.
- Commit and push succeed without warnings about embedded repos.
