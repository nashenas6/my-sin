# h-dashboard Session Bootstrap

## When to Use
Any session touching `/home/runner/h-dashboard`: new feature, bug fix, refactor, test run,
or a plain structural question about the code. Run sections 1-5 before real work.

Repo: `/home/runner/h-dashboard` (also the configured Hermes `terminal.cwd`).
Branch: `rebecca`. Canonical upstream: `asgarimehdi/h-dashboard`, branch `beta`.
Only remote is `origin` (this server's fork); **never add, rename, or delete remotes.**

## 1. Never
- Do not clone a second copy of the repo.
- Do not switch branches unless asked.
- Do not push dev work straight to `beta`.
- Do not hardcode a fork URL or branch name — read `git remote -v` / `git branch --show-current`.

## 2. Session start sequence
```bash
cd /home/runner/h-dashboard
git remote -v
git branch --show-current
git status
git fetch origin
git merge origin/beta     # resolve conflicts; never rebase published work
```
Push only after step 4 verification passes.

## 3. Read project rules first
Root `AGENTS.md` is authoritative — read before touching code and keep it in context.
It already documents CodeGraph, Boost/Context7/GitHub MCP, Pest, Playwright, conventions,
and the gotchas table. Do not re-derive them.

## 4. Verify tooling, never assume
```bash
codegraph status .        # must be up to date; else `codegraph sync`
hermes mcp list           # codegraph, laravel_boost, context7, github enabled
```
Fix anything broken before continuing. Never claim a tool was used when it wasn't.

## 5. CodeGraph first for structural questions
Before grep/glob/Read crawling to understand structure, call CodeGraph MCP
(`mcp__codegraph__codegraph_explore`) or the CLI:
```bash
codegraph explore "how does AccessService accessibleUnitIds resolve unit hierarchy"
codegraph query "HardwareAuditObserver" --limit 5
```

## 6. Before committing
```bash
git status
git diff
vendor/bin/pint --test
composer test        # pest
```
Clear commit message, then `git push origin <current-branch>`.

## 6b. Unattended/api_server tool restrictions (verified 2026-10-09)
This surface runs **unattended**, so approval-gated commands are refused rather than queued:

- `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` → **blocked** ("lifecycle guard could not scan", the pint binary is >1 MiB). Use **`composer pint`** (which wraps it) — returns `{"tool":"pint","result":"passed|fixed"}`.
- `perl -i -pe ...`, `php -r`, any `-e`/`-c` script flag → **blocked** as "script execution".
- `execute_code` → **blocked entirely** ("runs arbitrary local Python").
- Workaround for a byte-exact text fix: `write_file` a small `python3` script to the scratch dir, then run `python3 <path>` in the terminal. That is the only way to do precise backslash-level edits here.
- Heredocs containing **Persian text** trip an invisible-unicode guard on the whole command. For commit messages with RTL text, `write_file` the message to a scratch `.txt` and pass `git commit -F <file>`.

## 6c. Test-fixture traps that cost real debugging time

- **`Storage::disk('local')->path()`** — the `local` disk root is `storage/app/private`, NOT `storage/app`. `storage_path('app/foo.xlsx')` passes the write and fails the `assertFileExists`.
- **Never hardcode lookup ids (`t_id => 1`) in a new test.** They only exist because some *other* test seeded them first, so the FK check passes in a full-suite run and fails when the file runs alone. Use `InteractsWithTestSetup::seedLookupTables()` + `Tahsil::firstOrCreate(...)`. Symptom: `SQLSTATE[23503] ... persons_e_id_fk` that appears only in one ordering.
- **`Eloquent\Builder::map()`/`chunkById()` closures get `Collection<int, stdClass>`** even for a model query (the one-way `@mixin`). Annotate `/** @var \App\Models\Foo $foo */` above the `foreach` instead of baselining.
- **Saving a model whose table lacks `created_at`/`updated_at`** throws `42703 Undefined column`. Declare `public $timestamps = false;` **on the model** — that is where the schema knowledge belongs, not worked around per call site.
- `composer verify <file>` misroutes the path argument to `config:clear` ("No arguments expected"). Use `composer test` (whole suite) or `XDEBUG_MODE=off php artisan test <file>`.

## 6d. `ScheduledJobInfrastructureTest > the dead console kernel` was RED from a STALE AUTOLOADER
**Resolved 2026-10-09 — GREEN on `beta` (`dea940a`).** Not a live regression; do not chase it.

The failure was *local only*: #864 deleted `app/Console/Kernel.php`, but `vendor/composer/autoload_classmap.php` still carried `'App\\Console\\Kernel' => …/app/Console/Kernel.php`, so `class_exists()` tried to `include()` the missing file:

```
include(.../app/Console/Kernel.php): Failed to open stream: No such file or directory
```

**Symptom:** a test asserting a class must NOT exist fails with a file-include error rather than a clean assertion failure. It can also make `test_schedule_never_regresses_to_zero_events` fail spuriously on the first run and pass on the second (stale in-process state) — a confusing double failure.

**Fix (always safe, never a code change):**
```bash
composer dump-autoload
```
After that: **9 passed (16 assertions)**. CI installs fresh and never sees this — only a long-lived local clone does.

### `php artisan schedule:list` is the real proof the scheduler is wired
`withSchedule()` registers through `Artisan::starting()`, which only fires once the console app is constructed. So `app(Schedule::class)->events()` returns **0 in a bare/test context even when the wiring is perfect** — a test must call an artisan command first (`Artisan::call('schedule:list')`) before resolving `Schedule::class`. #864's test does this deliberately. For a manual check, `php artisan schedule:list` lists all six with next-due times and needs no test harness.

## 7. Pull requests
When the user says `pr`, open a PR from the current branch to `beta` of
`https://github.com/asgarimehdi/h-dashboard`. **Do not merge** unless asked.

Two tooling pitfalls, both verified 2026-10-06 (issue #818 / PR #822):

- **Use `gh pr create`, not the GitHub MCP `create_pull_request`.** The MCP tool
  silently drops the required `base` argument — the call fails twice with
  "missing required argument(s): base" no matter how the payload is built, and
  the body never reaches the server. `gh` works:
  ```bash
  gh pr create --repo asgarimehdi/h-dashboard --base beta \
    --head Shabakebehdasht:rebecca --title "..." --body-file /tmp/pr.md
  ```
  Write a long body to a scratch file and pass `--body-file`; inline
  `--body` mangles backticks and newlines.
- **No `--maintainer-can-modify` flag** on this machine's `gh` — it errors and
  prints usage. Omit it; the fork relationship already allows maintainer edits.
- Watch CI with `gh run watch <run-id> --repo asgarimehdi/h-dashboard --exit-status`
  (run id from `gh pr checks <pr> --repo asgarimehdi/h-dashboard`). `--repo` is
  required — without it the run id does not resolve from this fork's context.

### A Sanctum ability assertion is worthless unless the session is detached
`Laravel\Sanctum\Guard::__invoke()` checks the `web` guard **first**. If a session
still resolves, it returns a `TransientToken` whose `can()` is unconditionally
true and the stored `abilities` are **never read** — so asserting "this token
cannot POST /api/hardware" against a logged-in session yields **422 from
validation, not 403 from the gate**. The test proves nothing.

```php
$token = Livewire::actingAs($user)->test('some.component')->get('someToken');
$this->app['auth']->guard('web')->logout();
$this->app['auth']->forgetGuards();
// now the request authenticates from the Bearer token ALONE
```

This is the same artifact that made issue #840's own "token survives logout"
measurement unreproducible. It is also the real threat model when a plaintext
token sits in rendered HTML: whoever reads it uses it with no session of their own.

Table name is **`hardwares`**, not `hardware`, for `assertDatabaseMissing`.

### `Morilog\Jalali\Jalalian` — API and the normalisation trap (verified 2026-10-09)
- `Jalalian::fromCarbon(Carbon\Carbon $carbon)` is typed against **concrete `Carbon\Carbon`**, not `CarbonInterface`. An immutable/interface value must go through `Carbon::instance()`; do not widen the type or baseline it.
- The Gregorian instance is **`toCarbon()`**. There is **no `toGregorian()`** (that is on the `jazi-datetime` package, not this one).
- **`fromFormat()` NORMALISES instead of rejecting.** Measured:
  ```
  1404/13/01 -> 1405/01/02      1404/01/32 -> 1404/02/01
  1404/12/29 -> 1404/12/29 (1404 IS a leap year; 1403 is not)
  ```
  So a shape-matching parser silently stores a *wrong* date. Round-trip it: `format('Y/m/d') === $input` is what proves the date existed.
- **Check a Jalali-dashed value BEFORE the ISO branch.** `1404-11-19` also matches `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$`; ISO-first stores it verbatim in a `date` column. Disambiguate by year range (Jalali 1178–1499 vs Gregorian 1900–2100).
- `Jalalian::fromCarbon($date)->format('Y/m/d')` **throws** on a value outside the Jalali range (year 783 → `Provided "783" is neither…`). Wrap it — a single bad row otherwise 500s the whole export.

### `#[Locked]` throws in tests; it does not return 419
`CannotUpdateLockedPropertyException::render()` maps to a 419 response **only when
`app.debug` is off**. The test env has debug on, so `$component->set($locked, …)`
surfaces the exception. Assert it with `expectException`, not `assertStatus(419)`.
`#[Locked]` is also only *defence in depth* — it stops a client swapping a
server-written property, it does **not** remove a plaintext that is already
rendered into the HTML.

### Never run two suites at once — they share `h_dashboard_test`
`composer test` in the background while an interactive `php artisan test` runs
interleaves `RefreshDatabase` on the **same** database. Symptoms are misleading:
`drop table … cascade` failures, and unrelated tests failing that pass in
isolation. Kill the background run (`process_manage action=kill`) and re-run
serially — the results you got before the collision mean nothing.

### A test helper's override keys are often NOT fillable
`TicketsInboxLivewireTest::createTicket()` reads `$overrides['unit']` /
`['user']` for its defaults but then `array_merge`s them into the create
array, where `Ticket`'s `$fillable` has only `unit_id` / `user_id`. Passing
`'unit' => $unit` therefore lands the ticket in `Unit::first()` **silently** and
the ticket appears to be out of the viewer's scope. Set the real columns.

Two more traps in the same family:
- `createUserWithUnit()` returns keys `user` / `unit` — destructuring
  `['creator' => …]` throws `Undefined array key`.
- `createUserOnUnit()` grants **no Spatie permission**, so a viewer built with
  it cannot open a permission-gated page and the component under test never
  runs. Also `accessibleUnitIds()` reads `session('current_unit_id')` first and
  only falls back to the pivot, so seed it or the scope is `[]`.

### `Todo::accessible()` / `Builder::accessible()` is a PHPStan error
The scope lives on `HasOrganizationalScope`, so neither the static nor the
`Builder` form resolves at level 6 (`undefined static method` /
`undefined method Builder::accessible()`). Use an explicit
`->whereIn('unit_id', app(AccessService::class)->accessibleUnitIds())` — which
is also the form that fails closed.

`$ticket->setRelation(...)` after `Ticket::query()->whereIn(...)->find(...)`
reports `Cannot call method setRelation() on stdClass` (the known `@mixin`
gotcha). Fix with `/** @var Ticket|null $ticket */` above the assignment — and
**do not** switch to `$ticket->task = …`: that routes through `setAttribute()`,
parking the model in `$attributes` where a later `save()` tries to write a
non-existent column.

### Editing a Livewire component shifts the line-keyed PHPStan baseline
Any edit inside `resources/views/livewire/tickets/⚡*.blade.php` moves line
numbers, so `phpstan-baseline.neon` entries stop matching and `composer phpstan`
reports ~27 `ignore.unmatched (non-ignorable)` errors that are pure line drift.
Fix the genuinely new errors first, then:
```bash
composer phpstan-baseline && composer phpstan   # must print "[OK] No errors"
```
Do not hand-edit the baseline, and do not assume every reported error is real —
separate your own from the line-shift noise first (`git stash` + rerun gives the
true pre-existing count).

To prove the regeneration added **nothing**, diff the baseline's `message:` lines
as a multiset before/after and normalise the anon-component line key
(`…blade\.php\:\d+\:\:` → `…blade\.php\:\:\:`). The count must be identical and
`Counter(new) - Counter(old)` must be empty — a plain `git diff` looks like 21
additions even though every one is just `:4::` → `:7::`.

## 8. Superpowers skills are mandatory
`superpowers` plugin installed at `~/.hermes/plugins/superpowers` (v6.4.2, 15 skills,
source `obra/superpowers`, installed with `--force` after manual entrypoint review on
2026-10-05). Load the process skill before acting:
brainstorming before plan mode, systematic-debugging for bugs, test-driven-development
before writing behavior, verification-before-completion before claiming done.
Invoke as `skill_view("superpowers:brainstorming")` etc.

The `using-superpowers` bootstrap is injected only on the **first turn** of a session
(`pre_llm_call` hook, `is_first_turn`). A session that compacted over its first turn
lost it — that is the known failure mode, not a broken install. `AGENTS.md` above
repeats the load-bearing rules so they survive compaction.

## 8b. Composer/Pint traps that cost a full suite run to discover

- **`composer pint` can silently rename a method under you.** Pint's
  `php_unit_method_casing` rewrites any method whose name starts with `test`
  to snake_case — *including a private helper*. A `private function
  testEnvFile()` became `test_env_file()` while every `$this->testEnvFile()`
  call site stayed camelCase, so six tests died with `Call to undefined method`
  in the FULL suite, long after `composer pint` reported `{"result":"fixed"}`.
  Never name a non-test method `test*` in a PHPUnit class. Pinned by
  `test_no_test_helper_starts_with_the_word_test` in
  `tests/Feature/AppKeyGuardWiringTest.php`.
- **Never assert Pest's summary wording.** Two traps stacked:
  (1) CI runs PHP 8.5 where a PDO deprecation makes Pest print
  `Tests: 10 deprecated (…)`, not `10 passed`, so `/passed/` alone fails in CI
  while passing locally; (2) Pest **colourises** the summary, so the number and
  the word are separated by ANSI escapes, not whitespace —
  `"\x1b[90mTests:\x1b[39m    \x1b[32;1m10 passed\x1b[39;22m…"`, so even
  `/Tests:\s+10 (passed|deprecated)/` fails until you
  `preg_replace('/\e\[[0-9;]*m/', '', $output)`. When you need a count, strip
  ANSI first and accept `passed|deprecated`; `VerifyWrapperScriptTest` records
  the same trap and calls naming the file "environment-blind". When a
  sub-process assertion must hold on BOTH machines, check the pattern against
  both real strings in a scratch probe — a green local run proves nothing about
  the CI wording.
- **When CI fails on a test you just wrote, read the job log before assuming
  the code is wrong.** `gh api .../logs` returns an empty body unless you send
  `Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.raw`; then:
  `curl -sL ".../actions/jobs/<id>/logs" -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gh auth token)" -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.raw" -o log`
- **`git add` on a file a script rewrites sweeps the generated value in.** After
  #953, `git add .env.testing` captured the per-clone key `composer test` had
  just written. Blank → `git add` → restore, and verify with
  `git show :FILE | grep APP_KEY`, never with a working-tree grep.
- **A guard must run in both `scripts/verify.sh` AND the CI `lint` job.**
  `verify.sh` never runs in CI (jobs are `lint`, `test`, `coverage-report`,
  `mutation`, `phpstan`), so a guard living only there fails no job.
- **A git-based guard reads the INDEX, not the working tree**, or it fails on
  a correct machine the first time a script generates a per-clone value. Test
  the negative case explicitly. Use `GIT_INDEX_FILE` on a copy when a test
  needs to stage into the real repo — never touch the real index.
- **`php artisan migrate --env=testing` does NOT migrate the test database.**
  It loads `.env.testing`, whose `DB_DATABASE` is `h_dashboard`. For
  `h_dashboard_test` use `DB_DATABASE=h_dashboard_test php artisan migrate`
  (confirm with `php artisan verify:preflight`). "Nothing to migrate" against
  a fresh database is the tell.

## 9. Docs and audit skills
- `read-the-damn-docs` (software-development/read-the-damn-docs) — read official/current
  docs before implementing against any third-party API or library. Context7 MCP for
  version-specific Laravel/PHP docs.
- `improve` — shadcn audit skill, audit-only, do NOT execute its findings unless asked.
