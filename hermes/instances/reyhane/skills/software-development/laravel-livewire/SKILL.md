# Laravel 13 + Livewire 4 Development

## When to Use

Use this skill when writing PHP/Laravel code, Livewire components, Pest tests,
API Resource transformers, or E2E tests for a Laravel 13 + Livewire 4 project.

Standing conventions and pitfalls for Laravel/Livewire projects. Applies to
PHP code changes, test writing, and API resource transformers.

## Always-On Rules

1. **Run Pint before commit.** `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` is enforced in CI.
   If the wrapper is refused by a command-lifecycle guard (it reports the
   script is larger than the scan cap), invoke the same binary directly:
   `php vendor/laravel/pint/builds/pint --dirty --format agent`. Same tool, same
   result — don't skip the formatter because the shim was blocked.
2. **Clear config+route cache before running tests.** Stale `routes-v7.php`
   causes Livewire endpoint-hash mismatch — tests silently return 404 on
   `->set()`/`->call()`.
3. **Use `assertDatabaseHas` with all relevant fields.** Don't just assert on
   `title` — include `user_id`, `unit_id`, or any field the code was supposed
   to set. Partial assertions miss bugs.
4. **Test Resource transformers directly.** Don't rely solely on controller
   tests to cover API response shape — instantiate the Resource class and
   call `toArray(new Request())` to assert exact field contracts.
5. **E2E tests go in `tests/e2e/<feature>/`** with `.spec.ts` extension.
   Import from `../shared/fixtures` for `login`, `waitForLivewire`, etc.
6. **Regenerate PHPStan baseline after fixing errors.** When you fix errors
   that exist in `phpstan-baseline.neon`, the old entries become unmatched
   and PHPStan reports new errors. Run `vendor/bin/phpstan analyse
   --generate-baseline` after every fix round, then verify with
   `composer phpstan`. The baseline is **line-based**, so inserting or deleting
   lines above an existing baseline entry shifts it and produces both
   `ignore.unmatched` (non-ignorable) and duplicate errors. After regenerating,
   diff entry counts and state the direction: fewer entries is fine, any
   increase means real new errors. Entries that merely changed line number are
   not new debt — say which count dropped and why.
7. **A nullable column needs a nullable PHPDoc.** `@property int $unit_id` on a
   nullable column makes every `=== null` branch statically dead, and PHPStan
   reports the check as always-false — i.e. it flags legitimate org-wide /
   no-owner logic as unreachable and you would "fix" the error by deleting the
   branch that implements the feature. Check the migration before writing the
   PHPDoc, not after PHPStan complains.

## Pitfalls

- **`whenLoaded` returns `MissingValue`, not `null`.** When calling
  `toArray()` directly on a JsonResource (not through `toResponse()`),
  `whenLoaded('relation')` returns a `MissingValue` object. Tests must
  check `instanceof` or use `array_key_exists` — `assertNull()` fails.
- **Factory defaults ≠ nullable columns.** A migration with
  `->default('o-bell')` on a NOT NULL column means the factory must NOT
  pass `null` for that field. Use the default value, not `null`.
- **Faker `passthrough()` requires an argument.** Use
  `fake()->optional(0.6)->words(3)` or another generator for optional
  JSON fields — `passthrough()` needs a value parameter.
- **Carbon `toISOString()` ≠ ATOM format.** `toISOString()` returns
  `.000000Z` suffix; ATOM uses timezone offset. Use `strtotime()` for
  flexible ISO 8601 validation in tests.
- **UUID primary key models + HasFactory.** Models with manual UUID
  generation in `boot()` (via `Str::uuid()`) work with `HasFactory`.
  Don't add `HasUuids` trait — it would conflict with the manual boot
  logic.
- **PHPStan `auth()->id()` vs `Auth::id()` in Livewire blade components.**
  PHPStan types `auth()` as `Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Factory` which
  lacks `id()`. In anonymous-class Livewire blade components (single-file
  components with `return new class extends Component`), add
  `use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;` and call `Auth::id()` instead.
  `auth()->user()` works fine (returns User|null), but `auth()->id()`
  does not.
- **PHPStan generic type for HasFactory.** PHPStan level 6+ requires the
  generic type annotation on `use HasFactory`. Write
  `/** @use HasFactory<\Database\Factories\YourFactory> */` immediately
  above the `use HasFactory;` statement. Without it, PHPStan reports
  `missingType.generics`.
- **PHPStan `@property-read` on JsonResource.** When a Resource class
  accesses `$this->some_field` (magic proxied from the underlying model),
  PHPStan reports `property.notFound`. Fix: add `@property-read` PHPDoc
  annotations for every accessed field, then access via
  `$model = $this->resource;` with a `@var Model $model` cast. Match
  the pattern used by other Resources in the project (see
  `NotificationResource.php` for the reference implementation).
- **PHPStan without larastan degrades an Eloquent chain to `Query\Builder`
  after `whereIn()`.** `Eloquent\Builder` declares `@mixin Query\Builder`, so
  the first call PHPStan resolves through the mixin types the receiver as
  `Query\Builder` and any later Eloquent-only call fails with
  `Call to an undefined method Illuminate\Database\Query\Builder::with()/withCount()`.
  **Fix (verified — clears the error with zero baseline entries): end every
  chain on a call that `Eloquent\Builder` defines itself.** Put eager loads
  first, then move the scope filters into a trailing closure —
  `->where(function ($q) use ($ids) { $q->whereIn(...); })` — or filter by key
  with `whereKey($ids)` instead of `whereIn('id', $ids)`. `where()` and
  `whereKey()` are declared on the Eloquent builder with `@return $this`, so the
  body returns an Eloquent builder and `return.type` disappears; callers already
  honour the declared `@return Builder<Model>`. Do NOT reach for an inline
  `@var`/`assert()` to override the inferred type — PHPStan rejects that
  explicitly. Only a chain that must end on a mixin-only call
  (`orderBy()`/`limit()` before `get()`) still reports; that residual goes into
  the regenerated baseline (Always-On rule 6). The root fix is larastan, which
  this project does not run.
- **`updateOrCreate` overwrites ownership on edit.** When using
  `Model::updateOrCreate(['id' => $editingId], [...])` and one field
  (e.g. `user_id`, `created_by`) should only be set on create — not on
  update — do NOT include it in the attributes array. The update path
  would overwrite the original value. Instead, omit the field from
  `updateOrCreate`, then conditionally set it after:
  ```php
  $model = Model::updateOrCreate(['id' => $editingId], [...]);
  if (! $editingId) {
      $model->update(['user_id' => Auth::id()]);
  }
  ```
- **`Storage::fake()` takes one disk name, not an array.** `Storage::fake(['local','public'])`
  throws `TypeError: getRootPath(): Argument #1 ($disk) must be of type string, array given`.
  Call it once per disk: `Storage::fake('public'); Storage::fake('local');`. The error
  surfaces as a `TypeError` inside the facade, which reads like a framework bug rather
  than a bad argument.
- **Assert the disk is empty, not only the status code.** For a route that writes a file,
  pair the status assertion with `Storage::disk($d)->allFiles()` on every disk the
  request could have chosen. A request that returns 404 can still have written something
  earlier in a middleware chain.

## Extracting a Reusable Nested Component

When one single-file Livewire component holds two responsibilities, split it
into a child component and a thin parent page:

1. Move the mechanics **verbatim** into `resources/views/livewire/<ns>/<name>.blade.php`.
   The child owns state and methods; the parent keeps access checks, detail
   panels and page chrome (header, theme selector).
2. Child → parent: `$this->dispatch('event', id: $id)` in the child,
   `#[On('event')] public function handler(int $id)` on the parent. Dispatched
   **named** arguments must match the listener's parameter names.
3. Per-node render hooks: pass a Blade view name plus a data array down as
   props and `@include($view, ['unit' => $unit, 'data' => $data])` in the node
   partial. Never let the child query page-specific data per node — that is the
   N+1 trap the extraction exists to remove.
4. Retarget mechanics tests to the child; keep auth/panel/render tests on the
   parent.

Test contract after the split:
- Parent `assertSee()` **does** include child-rendered HTML (children render
  inline), so page-level render assertions keep working.
- Parent `->get('prop')` / `->call('method')` do **not** reach the child — assert
  child state with `Livewire::test('child', $props)` and drive the parent through
  the event: `Livewire::test('parent')->dispatch('event', id: ...)`.
- Cover both halves of the wiring: `->assertDispatched(...)` on the child proves
  it fires, `->dispatch(...)` on the parent proves the listener runs. Asserting
  only the parent's handler by direct `->call()` passes even when the event is
  never dispatched.
- Batch level-wise loads (`whereIn('parent_id', $ids)`) rather than one query
  per node, and pin the result with a measured query-count assertion so the N+1
  cannot come back.

## Merge Conflicts in Auto-Generated Files

When a PR has merge conflicts with `upstream/beta` in auto-generated files
(like `phpstan-baseline.neon`), do NOT manually merge the conflict markers.
These files are machine-generated — manual merge produces invalid output.

**Procedure:**
1. `git fetch upstream beta && git merge upstream/beta`
2. For the conflicted auto-generated file: `git checkout --theirs <file>`
   (take upstream's version as starting point)
3. `git add <file>`
4. Regenerate from scratch: `vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --no-progress --generate-baseline`
5. Verify: `composer phpstan`
6. `git add <file> && git commit --no-edit`
7. `git push origin <branch>`

**Never** edit phpstan-baseline.neon by hand to resolve conflicts.
The regenerate step produces the correct baseline for the current code state.

## Merge Conflicts in Hand-Written Files

The inverse case — two contributors each appending to the same hand-maintained
file, which is exactly what a shared doc table or a common service provider
produces. Resolve by **keeping both sides**, not by picking a winner:

1. Read the conflicted region and classify it. Two contributors each adding an
   import line or a table row is an *additive* conflict: concatenate both,
   keeping the file's existing ordering convention.
2. After resolving, verify each side actually survived — `grep -c` every
   symbol both sides contributed. Cleaning up markers proves nothing; a
   dropped `use` line or a deleted doc row is silent until something breaks.
3. Re-run the full quality gates on the merged tree. The merge brought in
   other people's changes, so a passing suite from before the merge says
   nothing about the tree you are now committing.

Never resolve by `git checkout --ours` or `--theirs` on a hand-written file
just because the conflict looks small — that silently discards a
contributor's change, and for a shared provider or doc file the loss is not
visible in your diff at all.

## Organisational scope on a Livewire page (multi-tenant read + write)

When a page gates only a coarse permission (`manage_hardware`, `manage_personnel`)
but neighbouring pages in the same route group scope every path through
`AccessService::accessibleUnitIds()`, the page leaks cross-unit rows. Fix all
four surfaces, not just the list:

- **List** — an *unconditional* predicate: `where(function ($q) { $q->whereNull('unit_id'); if (!empty($ids)) { $q->orWhereIn('unit_id', $ids); } })`.
  Never `when($ids, …)`: an empty scope silently drops the predicate and returns
  the whole org (the fail-open trap). Decide explicitly whether null-owner rows
  (org-wide) are visible; say so in the PR.
- **Options/pickers** — filter the option list to in-scope ids too. A picker
  that offers every unit lets the user submit an id the list would never show.
- **Mutators** — resolve the record, then assert it is in scope before touching
  state. Route-model binding gives you the record, not permission to change it;
  `$editingId` from the client is attacker-controlled.
- **Submitted foreign keys** — a create/update that accepts `unit_id` must
  validate the *submitted* value against scope, not only the loaded record.
  Otherwise an edit can relocate a row across the boundary, which also
  redirects any cron/queued side effect that fires on that foreign key.

Share one `assertXInScope()` helper across every mutator so the list and the
mutators cannot drift, and use the sibling page's refusal style (error toast +
`return`) instead of inventing a 403. Order matters in `updateSchedule`:
validate the record **and** the submitted unit, and `return` before any
`$schedule->update(...)`.

**Admin-only org-wide rows must be admin-only on write too.** If null-owner
rows are visible to everyone but mutable only by an admin, then letting a
scoped user create or promote one lets them write a record they can then
neither edit nor delete — and hand themselves an org-wide side effect through a
scoped form. Gate the write path on the same rule; keep the "no unit" option
in the picker so existing org-wide rows stay viewable.

8. **A package-registered route cannot be toggled off — strip it on `booted`, from inside a booted hook.** UI packages that call `loadRoutesFrom()` in their own `boot()` (maryUI does this) register routes the application never declared and cannot undeclare through config. Remove them by name from the router in `AppServiceProvider::boot()`. See "Removing a package-registered route" below — the two subtleties (compiled collections, hook ordering) each make the naive version silently do nothing.
9. **A full-suite failure that passes in isolation is shared state, not your diff.** Do not assume it is yours, and do not "fix" it. Reproduce on the default branch with the same seed: `git stash push --include-untracked`, run, `git stash pop`. Note that adding or removing test files changes the execution order a seed produces, so "same seed passed on beta" is only comparable when the file set is identical. Report an unrooted flake by name in the PR body rather than silently rerunning until green.

## Removing a package-registered route

A vendor package's `ServiceProvider::boot()` calling `loadRoutesFrom()` registers
routes the app never declared, and no config flag removes them. Strip by route
name from the router instead:

```php
$this->app->booted(function () {
    // Registered from INSIDE a booted callback — see below.
    $this->app->booted(fn () => VendorRouteGuard::strip(
        $this->app->make(Router::class),
        'vendor.package.route'
    ));
});
```

Two traps make the obvious version a silent no-op:

- **`route:cache` makes mutating a Route useless.** Cached routes produce a `CompiledRouteCollection` whose `match()` reads a flat, pre-built index and whose Route objects are instantiated fresh from `$attributes` on *every* call. Editing one changes nothing about what matches. Rebuild the collection without the target and re-`compile()` it, which regenerates both halves of `setCompiledRoutes()`. Handle both collection shapes (`RouteCollection` and `CompiledRouteCollection`) in the guard — the uncached rebuild is a few lines, but the cached path is the one that gets skipped and the bug ships.
- **A hook registered straight from `boot()` runs too early.** Routes are themselves populated by booted callbacks (`AppRouteServiceProvider`, plus the `require` of the cached route file), so your hook can fire before the vendor route exists. `Application::fireAppCallbacks()` re-checks the callback count each pass, so nesting one `booted()` inside another is what places yours last on both the cached and uncached paths.

Test all three states, not just the default one: uncached, freshly
`route:cache`d, and a **stale cache built by the pre-fix code** (build it by
stashing the fix, then `route:cache`). The stale case is the one that
represents an already-deployed app, and it is the only one that proves the
hook ordering. Verify with `php artisan route:list --path=<uri>` under each.

Keep the package's *other* routes. A layout component calling
`route('vendor.package.other')` on every render means removing it 500s every
page — check the routes against actual view usage before stripping, and pin the
survivors in a test so a later "cleanup" does not take them.
